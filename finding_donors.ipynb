    "\n",
    "In this project, you will employ several supervised algorithms of your choice to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. You will then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. Your goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations.  Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with.  While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, we can (as we will see) infer this value from other publically available features. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income). The dataset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the article _\"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid\"_. You can find the article by Ron Kohavi [online](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf). The data we investigate here consists of small changes to the original dataset, such as removing the `'fnlwgt'` feature and records with missing or ill-formatted entries."

    "For highly-skewed feature distributions such as `'capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`, it is common practice to apply a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transformation_(statistics)\">logarithmic transformation</a> on the data so that the very large and very small values do not negatively affect the performance of a learning algorithm. Using a logarithmic transformation significantly reduces the range of values caused by outliers. Care must be taken when applying this transformation however: The logarithm of `0` is undefined, so we must translate the values by a small amount above `0` to apply the the logarithm successfully.\n",

    "\n",
    "From the table in **Exploring the Data** above, we can see there are several features for each record that are non-numeric. Typically, learning algorithms expect input to be numeric, which requires that non-numeric features (called *categorical variables*) be converted. One popular way to convert categorical variables is by using the **one-hot encoding** scheme. One-hot encoding creates a _\"dummy\"_ variable for each possible category of each non-numeric feature. For example, assume `someFeature` has three possible entries: `A`, `B`, or `C`. We then encode this feature into `someFeature_A`, `someFeature_B` and `someFeature_C`.\n",

    "| 1 |  C  | ----> one-hot encode ----> | 0 | 0 | 1 |\n",
    "| 2 |  A  |  | 1 | 0 | 0 |\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, as with the non-numeric features, we need to convert the non-numeric target label, `'income'` to numerical values for the learning algorithm to work. Since there are only two possible categories for this label (\"<=50K\" and \">50K\"), we can avoid using one-hot encoding and simply encode these two categories as `0` and `1`, respectively. In code cell below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    " - Use [`pandas.get_dummies()`](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.get_dummies.html?highlight=get_dummies#pandas.get_dummies) to perform one-hot encoding on the `'features_raw'` data.\n",
    " - Convert the target label `'income_raw'` to numerical entries.\n",

    "### Metrics and the Naive Predictor\n",
    "*CharityML*, equipped with their research, knows individuals that make more than \\$50,000 are most likely to donate to their charity. Because of this, *CharityML* is particularly interested in predicting who makes more than \\$50,000 accurately. It would seem that using **accuracy** as a metric for evaluating a particular model's performace would be appropriate. Additionally, identifying someone that *does not* make more than \\$50,000 as someone who does would be detrimental to *CharityML*, since they are looking to find individuals willing to donate. Therefore, a model's ability to precisely predict those that make more than \\$50,000 is *more important* than the model's ability to **recall** those individuals. We can use **F-beta score** as a metric that considers both precision and recall:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F_{\\beta} = (1 + \\beta^2) \\cdot \\frac{precision \\cdot recall}{\\left( \\beta^2 \\cdot precision \\right) + recall} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, when $\\beta = 0.5$, more emphasis is placed on precision. This is called the **F$_{0.5}$ score** (or F-score for simplicity).\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the distribution of classes (those who make at most \\$50,000, and those who make more), it's clear most individuals do not make more than \\$50,000. This can greatly affect **accuracy**, since we could simply say *\"this person does not make more than \\$50,000\"* and generally be right, without ever looking at the data! Making such a statement would be called **naive**, since we have not considered any information to substantiate the claim. It is always important to consider the *naive prediction* for your data, to help establish a benchmark for whether a model is performing well. That been said, using that prediction would be pointless: If we predicted all people made less than \\$50,000, *CharityML* would identify no one as donors. "

    "###### **Answer: \n",
    "                                    **Support Vector Machines(SVM)**\n",
    "**Real-world application:** \n",
    "Radial basis function(rbf) SVM was used as a classifier in the computer-aided analysis(CAD) of SPECT scans (brain-scan images) of people with and without early Alzheimer's disease(AD). Analyzing these images without CAD and a machine learning algorithm over-consumes time and increases likelihood of misclassification due to natural human error. The SVM, in this study, achieved 90.38% accuracy in diagnosing early AD.(^1) \n",
    "\n",
    "**Strengths:** \n",
    "-*(a) Decision-Boundary Flexibility: SVMs, due to several kernel functions, can generate non-linear decision boundaries for more complicated datasets. \n",
    "-*(b) Memory efficiency: SVMs use only a subset of the training data, the support vector points, to form the edges of the functional margin and the decision boundary through the middle. \n",
    "-*(c) Feature flexibility: good performance even on datasets with many features or dimensions, especially on the preprocessed census data with 103 features/dimensions. \n",
    "-*(d) Imbalance parameters: parameters 'class_weight' and 'C' and be adjusted to adapt the SVM model to unbalanced data, which applies in this case (our dataset has the imbalance of 25% positive/75% negative labels). \n",
    "\n",
    "**Weakness**: \n",
    "-*(a) SVMs may not work well with 'large' datasets because of the quadratic programming process that maps support vectors to higher dimensional space to find the separating hyperplanes, which results in high computational and time cost. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Current application:** \n",
    "With untuned parameters the model scored at 83% accuracy and took about 6.4 minutes, which clarified that the temporal cost and accuracy is acceptable, though compared to the other two applied models, it is the slowest. \n",
    "________________________________________________________________________________\n",
    "                                    K-Nearest Neighbors(KNN) \n",
    "Real-world application:\n",
    "KNN, with association rules such as Apriori algorithm, was used to increase the accuracy of fraud detection in credit card transactions for online banking(^2). \n",
    "\n",
    "KNN strengths: \n",
    "-(a) works well with a large dataset, so 45,222 data points will not be a problem for this model \n",
    "-(b) robust to noisy points in the dataset;the model is not overly affected by outliers \n",
    "-(c) no restrictions from assumed learning concepts; this model finds the underlying similarity between the query and instance data points using a flexible number of parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "KNN weaknesses: \n",
    "-(a) time-consumption from higher memory and computation cost due to memorization of all the training examples and scanning all the instance data points in relation to the query points when predicting. \n",
    "-(b) finding the ideal 'distance' metric to accurately capture the similarity between a query point and the k nearest points. \n",
    "\n",
    "Current application: this model is appropriate for this dataset because the model yields 82% accuracy from the default k parameter, and takes less than 3 minutes to yield a prediction.\n",
    "  \n",
    "                                 Ensemble method of Gradient Boosting Classifier(GBC)\n",
    "Real-world Application: from a dataset of 1,194 patients, where 378 actually had Parkinson's Disease(PD), a gradient boosting algorithm yielded a classification with 92% accuracy(^3). This could be a baby step towards preemptively diagnosing and more effectively treating PD. \n",
    "\n",
    "Strengths: (a) fairly robust to overfitting, not overly influenced by outliers (compared to a single decision and other traditional machine learning algorithms) (b) generally yields better predictions than other ensemble learners and traditional algorithms\n",
    "\n",
    "Weaknesses: (a) generally, compared to Random Forests and Bagging, GB is more prone to overfitting/high variance (b) takes more time compared to the other ensemble learners and traditional algorithms especially on this dataset \n",
    "\n",
    "Current application: although the untuned Gradient Boosting Classifier took longer than the other two to train and predict, the combined training/prediction time over the entire dataset is less than a minute. GBC yields the highest accuracy score out of all the pre-tested algorithms at about 86%.\n",

GB performs slower than KNN and much faster than SVC, but in absolute time GB total time to prediction takes less than a minute over 100% of the dataset.

    "To provide an intuitive explanation of the gradient boosting algorithm, we start with the basic defintion of an algorithm: a sequence of instructions that tells a computer what to do. A learner is an algorithm that makes inferences from data. Next, the gradient boosting algorithm is an ensemble learner. What is 'ensemble learner'? It is a collection of learners, where each individual learner is 'weak' because it makes inferences that have a high proportion of misclassified donors; in some instances the accuracy of the initial learners are only slightly better than a random guess. The particular class of learner used in the gradient boosting alorithm applied to this particular group of donors are tree classifiers, which are often used (but not required) in a gradient boosting algorithm. A tree classifier makes inferences from a dataset by a series of questions like playing the game 20 Questions, where a question is asked based on a feature (i.e. \"What is the donor's education level?\"), which results in a Yes or No(True or False), which leads to another yes/no feature question, and so on, with the ultimate end of yes/no(true/false) regarding the donor's salary as above 50K. The tree classifiers in this ensemble are 'weak' because they ask less questions, from 4 to 8 questions. Asking a low number of questions prevents the ensemble of tree classifiers from merely memorizing all the details for every donor in this dataset; if the ensemble memorizes everything about the donors in this one group of donors, it won't be able to accurately classify donors outside the group.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we break down the terms 'boosting' and 'gradient'.\n",
    "About 'boosting': the gradient boosting algorithm (in the case of this potential donor dataset)uses a sequence of 'weak' tree classifers where each successive tree slightly \"boosts\", or increases, its accuracy from its immmediate predecessor tree classifier by weighting the misclassified donors of this previous tree classifier, which refocuses the next tree classifier on those mistakes. So overall the first tree classifier has the weakest performance, the next tree classifier improves its classification score from the weighted mistakes of first, the third improves its score based on the weighted mistakes of the second, and so on until the last tree classifier has a 'strong' performance, or a classification score that is up to an acceptable level of performance. Boosting is enabled by adding the 'gradient' of each previous tree classifier to the next tree classifier. To understand the 'gradient' we have to understand these three concepts: 'function', 'loss function' and 'derivative'. A function maps one or more inputs to one or more outputs. The inputs here are the actual donor salaries and the classification of the salaries from the tree classifiers, whch are inputted into a loss fucntion. A 'loss function' is a function that maps each of these inputs to an output that represents the 'loss' of each learner's predictive power, or the difference between actual donor salary and classified donor salaries. To get the lowest possible ouptput from the loss function to find the best learner, we take the 'derivative' of the loss function. The 'derivative' is a major conceptual tool used in calculus for finding lowest and highest values of functions. Taking the 'derivative' of a function allows us to find the output extremes because when the derivative of a function equals zero it corresponds to one of the lowest or highest values of the function's output. The 'gradient' is the derivative of a given loss function. We take the negative gradient, to get to the lowest possible output from the loss function (if we took the positive gradient that would result in learners with increasingly weaker performance).  Overall, there are many tree classifiers (successive trees are like descending gradient steps down a 'hill of error') along the sequence learners, each one better than the prior, ending at one last tree classifier with the highest possible accuracy and lowest error (within the limits of the gradient boosting algorithm).\n",

Education has the highest cumulative feature weight, which matches the ranking of my intuition. Marriage has a higher feature weight than age, though less on the cumulative than, which about fits my initial sense of their importance. For the two with the highest feature weights (though lowest cumulative), it makes sense to me that successful investments or very unsuccessful investments in real estate and/or stocks/bonds would have highest feature weights since investors are known for being the highest monetary gainers and monetary losers such as Warren Buffet and Donald Trump.**"

With less features required to train, the expectation is that training and prediction time is much lower — at the cost of performance metrics. From the visualization above, we see that the top five most important features contribute more than half of the importance of **all** features present in the data. This hints that we can attempt to *reduce the feature space* and simplify the information required for the model to learn. The code cell below will use the same optimized model you found earlier, and train it on the same training set *with only the top five important features*. "
